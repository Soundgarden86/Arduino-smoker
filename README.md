# Arduino-smoker

## Description
In this collection you will find all created proof of concepts from the Arduino Smoker project.
Blynk is an app that allows the temperature to be measured remotely through the phone or tablet. 
There is also a stepper motor proof of concept that serves as a fuel supply. 

## Usage
- Arduino code

## Installation
